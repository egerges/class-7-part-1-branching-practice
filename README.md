## Introduction
Trivia games for your entertainment.

### Overview
The exercise for this class is split into 2 parts.

#### Part 1
In this exercise you will continue to explore Git and GitHub in general, and branching in particular.

Start by coming up with _at least_ 3 trivia questions (for example: "Who created Git?"; "What is the Unix epoch"; "What is the largest positive number that can be represented using 8 bits of data?"). Then complete the following:

- Create a new local Git repository.
- Add the questions to a README.md document and commit the result.
- Create a new GitHub repository named: class-7-exercise-part-1.
- Connect the local and remote repository and push your trivia questions to GitHub.

After you've setup the repository in GitHub, create a new branch to answer each question. Each branch must contain *exactly* one answer. This means that if you define 3 questions then you should have 3 branches, each with 1 answer. You're free to make these updates locally or directly in GitHub. If you choose to work locally please make sure to push _all_ of your branches to the remote repository before submitting the exercise.

The subject matter for the questions is up to you, so feel free to have fun with them. Oh, and please don't use the example questions above!
